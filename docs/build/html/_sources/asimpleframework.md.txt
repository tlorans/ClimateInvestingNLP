# A Simple End to End Framework

In order to explore how Natural Language Processing can help in addressing climate investing issues, we propose a simple end to end framework, starting with an algorithm adapted from Sautner et al. (2020) {cite:p}`2020:Sautneretal` to construct firm-level exposure to a climate theme (later exposure to green activities and exposure to climate risks) and follow Roncalli's approach (2023) {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` for the benchmark tilting.
