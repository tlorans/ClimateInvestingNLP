# Green Activities in the S&P 500 Universe

Below is the boxplot of our green activities exposure based on the S&P 500 universe, grouped by GICS sector (level 1 of the classification system). Unsurprisingly, aside some potential outliers / errors in other sectors, Energy, Industrials, Information Technology (Solar PV panels are classified as Semiconductors into this sector according to GICS for example) and Materials are among the sectors with the most potential exposure to green technologies. More surprisingly, there is few companies with green technologies exposure the Utilities sector. This can be due to non-exhaustive specific keywords targeting potential climate solutions into these sectors.
