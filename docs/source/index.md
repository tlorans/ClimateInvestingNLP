# Investigating the Transition Dimension in Climate Investing with Natural Language Processing

In this project, we investigate if Natural Language Processing can be helpful to tackle the transition dimension in climate investing.

Transition dimension is underlooked due to lack of reported data by firms. Recognizing this lack of structured and standardized data, we propose an end to end framework relying on automatic treatment of unstructured data (text) with Natural Laguage Processing. 

We propose a transition portfolio, focusing on tilting an initial benchmark towards firms more exposed to green technologies. Interesingly, properties of this portfolio are different from traditional decarbonization approach, noteworthy in terms of potential sectoral bias: as firms exposed to green technologies are mostly concentrated in transition impactful sectors such as Energy, Industrials or Materials, so is the resulting portfolio. On the other side, decarbonization-focused portfolio tends to be biased towards unimpactful sectors such as software or services, naturally less carbon intensitve, but less prone to contribute significantly to the transition to a low-carbon economy.
