# Uncovering Hidden Dimensions of Climate Investing with Natural Language Processing: an Exploratory Approach


In this project, we investigate if Natural Language Processing can be helpful in addressing what we think are underlooked dimensions in climate investing: (i) the transition dimension in net zero investing and (ii) the firm-level climate risks exposure.

Both dimensions are underlooked due to lack of reported data by firms. Recognizing this lack of structured and standardized data, we propose an end to end framework relying on automatic treatment of unstructured data (text) with Natural Laguage Processing. 

We propose a transition portfolio, focusing on tilting an initial benchmark towards firms more exposed to green technologies. Interesingly, properties of this portfolio are different from traditional decarbonization approach, noteworthy in terms of potential sectoral bias: as firms exposed to green technologies are mostly concentrated in transition impactful sectors such as Energy, Industrials or Materials, so is the resulting portfolio. On the other side, decarbonization-focused portfolio tends to be biased towards unimpactful sectors such as software or services, naturally less carbon intensitve, but less prone to contribute significantly to the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Regarding the climate risks component, we stop our investigation at the text mining step, as our first initial results doesn't allow for building a consistent climate risks hedging portfolio in our sense. First results are promising but would need much more work to lead to a consistent climate risks hedging portfolio construction.
