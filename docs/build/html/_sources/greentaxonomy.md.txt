# A Green Taxonomy

In order to be able to determine the degree of greeness of issuers based on their activities, one needs a green taxonomy to determine what is deemed to be green or not. 

## The EU Taxonomy

To provide a shared definition of green activites, the EU Commission has introduced the EU Taxonomy for sustainable economic activities, based on NACE codes. Activities are defined as green if they provide a contribution to a least one environmental objective (among six, even if technical screening critera have been developed for the two climate objectives only so far {cite:p}`2021:ANNEX1` {cite:p}`2021:ANNEX2`) while at the same time do not significant harm to other environmental objective. Furthermore, the activity must comply with minimum social safeguards (such as the UN guiding principles on business and human rights for example).

The main drawback of this initiative is that underlying data simply doesn't exist at the issuer level yet (Alessi and Battiston, 2022 {cite:p}`2022:AlessiBattiston`), at least as long as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is not implemented yet.

## Green, Brown or Mixed Taxonomy?

As noted by Roncalli et al. (2022) {cite:p}`2022:Roncallietal`, a green taxonomy may be restrictive since it tells us nothing about the browness of the issuer. Indeed, an issuer having an exposure to green activities of 30% doesn't means that 70% is brown, but could be neutral.

Differentiating exposure to green, brown and neutral activities can be helpful for investors. To do so, one needs to define both a green and a brown taxonomy. 

The goal of a green-based taxonomy is to identify more striclty green activities to promote them. With a green-based taxonomy, investors have no incentive to disinvest from brown activities, as those activities would be treated as the neutral activies.

This is not the case with a brown-based taxonomy, whose objective is to clearly promote exclusion strategies from brown activities.

Finally, a mixed taxonomy would combined both green and brown taxonomies, with neutral activities identified as the remaining ones.

The differences between the three approaches (green, brown, mixed taxonomies) are the counterpart of selection (green taxonomy), exclusion (brown taxonomy) and integration (mixed) in ESG strategies.

## Our Approach: A Mixed Taxonomy

We follow Alessi and Battiston, 2022 {cite:p}`2022:AlessiBattiston` by adopting the list of green activities (green, enabling and transitional activities) from the EU taxonomy, as listed in the Annex 1 {cite:p}`2021:ANNEX1`. However, due to the lack of data, we fill not follow the alignment process recommended by the EU taxonomy. Our approach stops at the first stage: the eligibility.

We recognize the need for a mixed taxonomy stated by Roncalli et al. (2022) {cite:p}`2022:Roncallietal`. In the absence of brown taxonomy from the EU Commission, we will follow the approach of the authors by using the activites in oil, gas and coal as a stringent definition of brown activities.
